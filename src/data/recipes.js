      "1/4 cup honey",
      "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)",
      "3 black tea bags",
      "3 cups water (1 cup boiling + 2 cups cold)",
      "Fresh mint leaves, for garnish",
      "Ice",
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Boil 1 cup of water. Pour over the tea bags in a heat-safe pitcher or large measuring cup. Steep for 3-4 minutes (longer for stronger tea), then remove the tea bags — don't squeeze them or the tea will taste bitter.",
      "While the tea is still hot, stir in the honey until fully dissolved. Honey dissolves much better in hot liquid.",
      "Add the fresh lemon juice and stir to combine. Taste — it should be noticeably sweet and tart, since the ice will dilute it.",
      "Pour in 2 cups of cold water to cool it down. Transfer to a pitcher and add plenty of ice.",
      "Gently tear or chop a few fresh mint leaves and add to the pitcher or individual glasses. Serve chilled.",
